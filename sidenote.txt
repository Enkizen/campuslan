A loopback address is a special IP address, 127.0. 0.1


RFC1918
IPv4 Private Address Space and Filtering
the following IPv4 address ranges are reserved by the IANA for private internets, and are not publicly routable on the global internet:
10.0.0.0/8 IP addresses: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0/12 IP addresses: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0/16 IP addresses: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

It is merely a necessity constraint and personal preference.

If a Network is being built that would only have 10, or 20, or 50, or even 100 hosts, there is no reason not to use a /24 from 192.168.0.0/16. This is why home networks typically use the 192.168.0.0 range.

If a Network is being built that would (in all growth projections) only have up to 1000 or 2000 users, then picking a few /20's in the 172.16.0.0/12 range is perfectly reasonable.

If a Network is being built that would (in all growth projections) possibly exceed that, then the 10.0.0.0 IP space is ideal.

That said, there are no rules or regulations. Anyone is free to use the 10.0.0.0 range or the 192.168.0.0 range for whatever network(s) they want.
